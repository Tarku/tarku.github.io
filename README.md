# Tarku's personal website 
This is my personal website where I will post things about programming, conlanging, music and maybe many more...

* Conlanging
  * My semitic-inspired old conlang written in the Arabic script, [Jachikh](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17uRctZbzQBCppSwa1q84JGgPc2ylESH-xBEUURg6OJc/edit?usp=sharing) (Incomplete)
  * A conlang inspired by Hungarian and Turkish, [Jedhlek](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10HhFDr5z55LpeLkvbulakPt9M-KWr-INY6h_-q_YxPo/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Yet another semitic inspired conlang, but with more experience with conlanging and sense of aesthetic, [Mowyāwan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oB78pBbQ3p-jFUtqhGSbQRni0Kh66kxmUxX2WhZT4Zo/edit?usp=sharing) (Incomplete)
  * A complete, kitchen sink language, inspired by many language and prolly one of the favorite conlangs I made, [Koritira](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MJleyN_rWlMI3m7HCMgVJ_JkjrYUrYYqQH-hDBmFfjg/edit?usp=sharing).
  * A romance conlang of mine, [Roumanic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bzDHof4i3RvxMHWn4fVhxEj9VUKKJuDuKHdypulV8pM/edit?usp=sharing) (Lhembà Roumanigà), the document is in French though.
  * A proto-lang and its descendants, [Proto-Itelsamar, Old Itelsamar and Old Ewizmar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0beLwAXdTRxSjjsW_yVIyj47pEroyeXEuqect8nqlQ/edit?usp=sharing)  
  * A Finnish and Turkish-inspired conlang spoken in the vast taigas of the Shänland, [Shäny](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBWOGAw_5EemhI76uhauYyqU4wXzHKZ-zz_TdIUghlU/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Yet another proto-lang and its descendants, spoken in Chashili and on the western coast of the Shänland [Proto-Yaltino-Chashilan, Chashilan and Yaltinan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KTGMW02pZj9XgGlHjvKEQbWkk5QMPRnV165XpwWWs8U/edit?usp=sharing)
  * A fairly weird language with both vowel and consonant harmony, and spoken in the jungle, [Ydzan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13zUVNPlWZBp0esCEzAzL0VajPakkvBFgLKT3MTFZZKE/edit?usp=sharing)
  * A conlang with a relatively simple phonology, spoken on the small, fairly subtropical island of Bat Ekanát, alongside with its offspring Nellá, with an orthography inspired by Quenya's, [Nédelat and Nellá](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16RijufX0dcQdNoSs--H2JU3SIFk4exEZd4vwJ_5mrno/edit?usp=sharing)

* Programming
  * My [Terraria Item Creator](https://tarku.github.io/programming/itemcreator/index.html), written in HTML and JS.
  * [PlanetNaka](https://tarku.github.io/programming/planetnaka/index.html), a Space Shooter game made with Unity.
  * A [verb conjugator for Shalshal](https://tarku.github.io/programming/shalshal-conjugator/index.html), another conlang of mine.
