# Tarku's personal website 
This is my personal website where I will post things about programming, conlanging, music and maybe many more...

* Conlanging
  * My semitic inspired old conlang written in the arabic script, [Jachikh](https://tarku.github.io/conlangs/jachikh/index) (Incomplete)
  * A conlang inspired by Hungarian and Turkish, [Jedhlek](https://tarku.github.io/conlangs/jedhlek/index) (Coming Soon!)
  * Yet another semitic inspired conlang, but with way more sense in it, experience with conlanging and sense of aesthetic, [MowyaÌ„wan](https://tarku.github.io/conlangs/mowyawan/index) (Coming Soon too!)
