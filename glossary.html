                    <h4>Conlang</h4>
                    <div>
                        A conlang, short for <b>con</b>structed <b>lang</b>uage, is a language that one creates. 
                        
                        There are many types of conlangs out there.
                        
                        Some are made for international communication, such as Esperanto or Ido. Those are called <i>international auxiliary languages</i>, or IAL for short.
                    
                        Some are made to be spoken in a fictional universe in a book for example, such as J. R. R. Tolkien's Quenya, or David J. Peterson's Dothraki or High Valyrian; even though these don't necessarily have a specific name in the conlanging community, are often considered to be personal languages.
                        While some others are made exclusively for fun of one person, such as Koritira. Those are called <i>personal languages</i>, or sometimes <i>persolangs</i> for short.

                    <h4>Conworld</h4>
                    <div>
                        Based on the same pattern as <i>conlang</i>, a conworld is a world that has been created by someone.

                    <h4>Worldbuilding</h4>
                    <div>
                        Worldbuilding is the process of creating a fictional world - or iterating on an existing one, such as our universe - for fun, or for example to include in a novel.
