                    <div>
                        Regarding music, I listen to many different styles, even though I really like Anatolian Rock, which is a style of music that is characterized by being rock, but which includes traditional Turkish musical instruments such as the <i>saz</i> (also known as <i>bağlama</i>), and having lyrics that are predominantly sung in the Turkish language.
                        <br/>

                        <br/>
                        My favorite musicians of that style are Barış Manço, Erkin Koray and Cem Karaca.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I also listen to other musicians belonging to different genres of Turkish music, such as Fikret Kızılok and Neşet Ertaş, as well as the Dutch-Turkish band Altın Gün, whose music is pretty great.
