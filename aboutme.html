                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <div style="font-size: 1.1em;">This page is where I will present myself more into details than in the homepage.</div>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4>Identity</h4>
                    <div>My name is Tark, I am <span id="age">0</span> years old.</div>
                    <br/>
                    <div>I consider myself to be a man and uses <i>he/him</i> pronouns.</div>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4>Languages spoken</h4>
                    <div>I come from France, but can speak English quite well (at least according to me).</div>
                    <div>The other languages I can speak a bit of are German, Japanese and Turkish, of which Japanese is the language I know the least how to speak, and German being the one I speak the best.</div>
                    <div>I also have some amount of knowledge about Latin and Esperanto, which are nice languages.</div>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                    <div>As I said in the homepage, I make conlangs on a regular basis.</div>
                    <div>I also worldbuild.</div>
                    <div>I am a musician. I play the piano, and I sometimes try to write music, but I usually stop 30 minutes after starting to do so, as I quickly become unsatisfied of what I write.</div>
                    <div>I am also a programmer, good lord I wouldn't be able to make this website without some programming skills.</div>
                    <div>I also sometimes create video games, mostly on Unity and Godot, but sometimes it happens to me to write games using no game engine, and when it is the case I will often code the game in C# using the Microsoft XNA Framework, which by the way is the framework with which games such as Terraria or Stardew Valley were made, or even sometimes in C++ with SDL2, or sometimes in Python with Pygame, even though Pygame is not super intuitive sometimes.</div>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4>Mental stuff</h4>
                    <div>I do have a lot of anxiety, predominantly social anxiety, but I suspect that I might have other disorders such as ADHD<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention%20Deficit%20Hyperactivity%20Disorder">[1]</a></sup> and ASD<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder">[2]</a></sup>, even though I do have less confidence about having these ones.</div>
