                        Over the years, I have made many conlangs, around 40 if I remember correctly.<br/>
                        Not every one of them will get its own page, since it'd be way too long to write 40 pages on conlangs I don't necessarily have a lot of documentation for.<br/>

                        I will try to keep a chronological order for each conlang I've made so far.

                        <a class="other_link" href="napani/index.html">Napani</a>
                    </h4>
                    <div>
                        Napani is the first language I've made that I called "conlang".<br/>
                        I've made it when I was around 11 to 13, so I didn't have much linguistic knowledge.<br/>
                        It is essentially a mix of French and Esperanto, a conlang I was very inspired by at the time.<br/>
                        It never was very stable though and pretty basic things such as conjugations changed a lot.

                    </h4>
                    <div>
                        Jachikh is the first language I made a phonology for.<br/>
                        It was pretty much only inspired by Arabic, using features like triconsonantal roots for example.<br/>
                        It is not the conlang I'm the proudest of though honestly, and also it contained a lot of "loanwords" from European languages.
